# Lab Resources

## Slack

Slack will be used as the primary means of lab communication, such as general lab announcements (`#-general`), sharing links, sharing and/or discussing papers (`#-papers`), and basically any message that can be sent without email. There's also a channel for keeping notes from our lab meetings (`#-lab-meetings`), as well as channels for specific projects (e.g. `#econdec`).

Try to keep each channel on topic, so that people can subscribe only to the channels that concern them. For messages to one person or a small group of people, use the direct message channels. Because we pay per Slack user, part-time RAs will be invited as "guests" to the `#undergrads` channel; these users can also use direct messages.

Full-time lab members should install Slack to their computers and/or phones. Part-time lab members should check Slack regularly. I get Slack updates on my phone and have do-not-disturb mode enabled for evening and night hours (meaning I will not get your messages then); I encourage you to do the same.

## Email
When it's appropriate to use email instead of Slack, such as when there is a lot to say at once or a long-form one-on-one discussion, such as negotiating lab hours, etc., feel free to do so. We also have a lab email account that goes to only the lab manager(s) and PhD students: `lighthall-lab@gmail.com`.

## GitHub

All projects that involve programming of any kind must use some form of version control. We have a [GitHub organization](https://github.com/lighthall-lab/) set up, allowing you to sync your code to the cloud and share it easily with other lab members.

Hosted on the lab's GitHub, you'll find a tutorial repository on the basics of using git for version control, and there is a `#-github` channel in Slack for questions, sharing, and discussion. We will also use GitHub for sharing script examples and hosting lab toolboxes for general use.

## Google Drive

The AD&D Lab folder on Google Drive is used to store documents and files for general lab use (e.g., IRB documents, stimuli, pdfs, etc). It can also be used for some forms of non-identifiable [data](#data-management).

## Google Calendar

Google Calendar is used to host a general lab calendar (AD&D Lab), as well as calendars for the in-lab testing rooms.
