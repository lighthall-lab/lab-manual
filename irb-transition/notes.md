## Software transition - what to expect
- some things will transfer, some will not

## What information will not transfer
- exempt determinations
- not human subjects determinations
- rely upon determinations

## investigator manual updates HRP-103
- addditional guidance on required training and who is eligible to serve as PI
- major changes to software instructions
- additional guidance on what group of forms/templates to use
- additional guidance on modification and continuing review requests
- additional single IRB (sIRB) informations for multi-site studies

## informed consent form changes HRP-502 502b
- major change-key information vs detailed information
    - link > ?
- additional language for studies involving the collection of identifiable information and biospecimens
- what hasn't changed? a lot of template language for you to select from and delete if not applicable

## protocol changes (expedited and board studies) HRP-403
- major reorganization
    - multi-site information moved to the end
- added revision history (!!!!)
- added study summary
- what hasn't changed?
    - a lot of template language for you to select from and **delete if not applicable**

## toolkit numbering changes/new forms
|--|--|
| HRP-500 research activity form | HRP-250 request for NHSR determinations |

## Routing changes
- currently, new submissions require PI, faculty advisor, and departmental signoff prior to submission to IRB
-- updates
    - HRP-251 Faculty advisor review   
        - faculty advisors complete the review form
        - student pi to upload the form with the study submission
        - submissions without the form will be returned without additional review
    - Faculty advisor and departmental sign-off added as an **Ancillary Reviewer**
        - Ancillary review may take place concurrently with IRB review

Instead of routing a submission through Nichole *before* it goes to the IRB, we would either have her fill out this form attached with the submission, **or** have her added an *Ancillary Reviewer*, along with Departmental chair or whoever else is signing off, for their review in parallel with IRB review.

(!!!) Everyone is already in the system, as long as they have a UCF NID (!!!)

## External team members
- currently listed on iRIS application in Ss 4.4
    - includes both engaged collaborators and other contacts
- now, its own form; only use if apllicable
    - HRP-253 external members

## Common Rule CHange 1/21/19
- mostly IRB SOPs and Worksheets
- major changes for researchers
    - changes to exempt categories:
        - "Brief Benign Behavioral interventions" (!!!)
            - not a clear definition for "brief", but sounds like all of our studies would apply
            - anything half-a-day or less, probably, including pre- and post-intervention measurements, etc.
        - "Limited irb review"
        - New instructions for restrospective data review "Secondary Research"
        - relevant protocol documents supposedly ready as of now, with template language for these categories
