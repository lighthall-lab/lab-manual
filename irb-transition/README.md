- additional guidance on modification and continuing review requests

#### Toolkit Numbering Changes / New Forms
|Was|Now|
|---|---|
| HRP-500 Research Activity Form | HRP-250 Request For NHSR Determination | 
| HRP-509 Summary Explanation Exempt Research| HRP-254 Summary Explanation Exempt Research|
| HRP-509 Request for Exempt Determination | HRP-255 Request for Exempt Determination |

#### Routing Changes
- currently, new submissions require PI, faculty advisor, and departmental signoff prior to submission to IRB
- Updates:
    - HRP-251 Faculty Advisor Review   
        - faculty advisors complete the review form
        - student PI to upload the form with the study submission
        - submissions without the form will be returned without additional review
    - Faculty advisor and departmental sign-off added as an **Ancillary Reviewer**
        - Ancillary review may take place concurrently with IRB review

Instead of routing a submission through Nichole *before* it goes to the IRB, we would either have her fill out HRP-251 and attach with the submission, *or* have her added an **Ancillary Reviewer**, along with Department Chair or whoever else is signing off, for their review in parallel with IRB review.

(!!!) Everyone is already in the system, as long as they have a UCF NID (!!!)

#### External team members
- Currently listed on iRIS application in Sub-section 4.4
    - includes both engaged collaborators and other contacts
- Now its own form; only use if applicable
    - HRP-253 External Members

#### Common Rule Change: 1/21/19
- mostly IRB SOPs and Worksheets
- major changes for researchers
    - changes to exempt categories:
        - *"Brief Benign Behavioral interventions" (!!!)*
            - not a clear definition for "brief", but sounds like all of our studies would apply
            - anything half-a-day or less, probably, including pre- and post-intervention measurements, etc.
        - "Limited irb review"
        - New instructions for restrospective data review "Secondary Research"
        - relevant protocol documents supposedly ready as of now, with template language for these categories
