# Questions
1. Will our studies that transfer into the new system change determination status if they fall under the new exempt categories (i.e., Brief Benign Behavioral Interventions)?
2. What exactly does exempt status entail for studies in this category, in terms of record-keeping and consent forms?
3. We have had issues with personnel leaving the lab and being removed from our protocols via amendment, only for them to continue appearing on our reviewers' end, eventually culminating in our submissions being "on hold until human subjects training is renewed". Is Huron expected to handle the interface between researchers' and reviewers' view of submissions any better than the old system?

# IRB training
## Project Wahoo
- Training Powerpoint: http://wahoo.research.ucf.edu/files/IRB-System-and-Toolkit-Updates.pdf
1. Toolkit changes
2. *Common Rule* changes
3. Software

# Software transition
## What to expect?
- some things will transfer, some will not

## What information will not transfer?
- Exempt Determinations
    - I don't think this applies to any of our studies
- Not Human Subjects Research (NHSR) Determinations
- Rely-Upon Determinations
    - Applies to projects where an external IRB is being deferred to
    - Consumer Judgment study might apply?

## Investigator Manual Updates: HRP-103
- addditional guidance on required training and who is eligible to serve as PI
- major changes to software instructions
- additional guidance on what group of forms/templates to use
- additional guidance on modification and continuing review requests
- additional single IRB (sIRB) informations for multi-site studies

## Informed Consent Form Changes: HRP-502 & HRP-502b
- major change-key information vs detailed information
    - link > ?
- additional language for studies involving the collection of identifiable information and biospecimens
- what hasn't changed? a lot of template language for you to select from and delete if not applicable

## protocol changes (expedited and board studies) HRP-403
- major reorganization
    - multi-site information moved to the end
- added revision history (!!!!)
- added study summary
- what hasn't changed?
    - a lot of template language for you to select from and _delete if not applicable_

## Toolkit Numbering Changes / New Forms
|Was:                                           |Now:                                           |
|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| HRP-500 Research Activity Form                | HRP-250 Request For NHSR Determination        | 
| HRP-509 Summary Explanation Exempt Research   | HRP-254 Summary Explanation Exempt Research   |
| HRP-509 Request for Exempt Determination      | HRP-255 Request for Exempt Determination      |  
| Individual Investigator Agreement             | HRP-252 Individual Investigator Agreement     | 

## Routing Changes
- currently, new submissions require PI, faculty advisor, and departmental signoff prior to submission to IRB
- Updates:
    - HRP-251 Faculty Advisor Review   
        - faculty advisors complete the review form
        - student PI to upload the form with the study submission
        - submissions without the form will be returned without additional review
    - Faculty advisor and departmental sign-off added as an **Ancillary Reviewer**
        - Ancillary review may take place concurrently with IRB review

Instead of routing a submission through Nichole *before* it goes to the IRB, we would either have her fill out HRP-251 and attach with the submission, *or* have her added an **Ancillary Reviewer**, along with Department Chair or whoever else is signing off, for their review in parallel with IRB review.

(!!!) Everyone is already in the system, as long as they have a UCF NID (!!!)

#### External team members
- Currently listed on iRIS application in Sub-section 4.4
    - includes both engaged collaborators and other contacts
- Now its own form; only use if applicable
    - HRP-253 External Members

#### Common Rule Change: 1/21/19
- mostly IRB SOPs and Worksheets
- major changes for researchers
    - changes to exempt categories:
        - **"Brief Benign Behavioral Interventions" (!!!)**
            - not a clear definition for "brief", but sounds like all of our studies would apply
            - anything half-a-day or less, probably, including pre- and post-intervention measurements, etc.
        - "Limited irb review"
        - New instructions for restrospective data review "Secondary Research"
        - relevant protocol documents supposedly ready as of now, with template language for these categories
    
    - Will requires new further toolkit changes

#### additional IRB-offered trainings
- 101 workshops
- IRB @ your doorstep
    - 101 workshop & Individual Consultation
